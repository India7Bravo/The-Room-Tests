# The-Room-Tests

Hello there,

In order to run my tests please either clone this repository or download the zipped folder, extract it and open it in your ideal IDE

Once opened in the IDE, you can proceed to open the terminal where you can open Cypress by typing "npx cypress open", hit the enter key and the app will start opening up

Once opened, you can hit the "Run 2 integration spec" button or run either test individually :) 

If there's anything that doesn't make sense, please do not hesitate to reach out :)
